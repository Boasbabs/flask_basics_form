The JSON library docs. 99% of the time, you won't need anything more than .loads() and .dumps()
Response: A response is the data that the server, Flask, sends back to the client.

make_response(): This function generates the entire response object that'll be sent back to the client, but lets you store it in a variable for further manipulation.

response.set_cookie(): Sets a cookie on the response object. Takes name for the cookie and a value.

json.dumps(): This method turns a Python data structure (list, string, dictionary, etc) into a JSON string.

json.loads(): This method turns a JSON string into a Python object.

COOKIES
______________
The JSON library docs. 99% of the time, you won't need anything more than .loads() and .dumps()
Response: A response is the data that the server, Flask, sends back to the client.

make_response(): This function generates the entire response object that'll be sent back to the client, but lets you store it in a variable for further manipulation.

response.set_cookie(): Sets a cookie on the response object. Takes name for the cookie and a value.

json.dumps(): This method turns a Python data structure (list, string, dictionary, etc) into a JSON string.

json.loads(): This method turns a JSON string into a Python object.

FLASH MESSAGES
-----------------
flash(): This function stores a message in the session that will self-destruct after the response is returned.

get_flashed_messages(): This function gets all of the flash messages stored in the session.

app.secret_key: This configuration attribute stores the secret key that all messages are cryptographically signed with.

{% with %}: The Flask template version of Python's with block. Let's you temporarily define a variable. Must be closed with {% endwith %}.
